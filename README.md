# Rust Notes App

This repo is just a little experiment, where I try to learn and improve my
Rust. I also try to make the best out of cargo, learning all its options and
functionalities in the way.

## Usage

+ `cargo r` or `cargo run` runs the project.
+ `cargo t` or `cargo test` runs unit tests.
+ `cargo d` or `cargo doc` builds the docs.
